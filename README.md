# Digital-Dice-Proteus-Bascom-AVR-Basic
Designing a simple digital(electronic) dice with ATMEGA 16, two 7-segments, LCD and key in Proteus and then coding it in BASCOM-AVR. 

We use two 7-segments as dices, one key for rolling or stopping the dices from rolling and a LCD to say hello and guiding the users.
