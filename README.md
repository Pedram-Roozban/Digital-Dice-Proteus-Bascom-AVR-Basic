# Digital-Dice-Proteus-Bascom-AVR-Basic
Designing a simple digital(electronic) dice with ATMEGA 16, two 7-segments, LCD and key in Proteus and then coding it in BASCOM-AVR. 

We used following things in this project:
- An Atmega 16.
- Two 7-segments as our dices. 
- One key for rolling or stopping the dices.
- One LCD to say hello and also guiding the users.

For using this project you just simply need to do following things:
- Open Proteus softeware(Run as admin) and then open The Digital_Dice_Circuit_Design.pdsprj file with it.
- Right click on Atmega 32 and then click on "Edit properties" or just simply Double click on Atmega 16.
- Give it the .obj or .hex porgram files.
- Set CKSEL Fuses to Int.Rc 8MHz.
- Click Ok.
- Start the simulation with Play icon on the buttom left corner. 

You can also edit the program file by opeing the Digital_Dice_Code.bas with BASCOM - AVR
